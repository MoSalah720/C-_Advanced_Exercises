# ⭐ C# Advanced Exercises — Delegates, Events, Generics & Observer Pattern

This repository contains a collection of practical exercises implementing **advanced C# concepts**, including Delegates, Events, EventHandler/EventArgs, Lambda Expressions, Generics, and full Event-Driven systems.

Each folder represents a standalone exercise that applies these concepts in real scenarios.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### ✔ Delegates & Multicast Delegates
- Declaring and invoking delegates  
- Delegate chaining  
- Anonymous methods  
- Lambda expressions  
- Generic delegates  

---

### ✔ Func / Action / Predicate
- Passing logic as parameters  
- Higher-order functions  
- Strategy Pattern through delegates  
- Clean, extensible behavioral programming  

---

### ✔ Generics
- Generic classes  
- Generic methods  
- Type constraints (`class`, `struct`, interfaces)  
- Using generics with delegates and functional code  

---

### ✔ Events & Observer Pattern
- EventHandler & EventHandler<T>  
- Custom EventArgs  
- Publisher/Subscriber architecture  
- Multi-subscriber event reactions  
- Decoupled system design  
- Real implementations of the Observer Pattern

## 📁 Project Structure

### 📌 Delegates_Exercise1  
Student grading system using Func, Action, Predicate, and clean delegate-based logic.

---

### 📌 Delegate_Exercise2  
Temperature sensor system using Events + EventArgs + multiple subscribers (Display / Alarm).

---

### 📌 Employee_Performance_System  
Performance evaluation workflow using higher-order functions for scoring, validation, and output.

---

### 📌 Stock_Price_Monitoring_System  
Observer Pattern implementation with Investor, Logger, and NewsAgency subscribers.

---

### 📌 Banking_Alerts_System  
Complete event-driven system:  
Deposits, withdrawals, SMS/email notifications, fraud detection, and security alerts.

---

### 📌 Delegate_Exercise3  
An improved Temperature Sensor system implemented with a **Broker (Publish/Subscribe Pattern)**  
instead of standard C# events, providing a decoupled event bus architecture.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

These exercises aim to:

- Strengthen understanding of advanced C# language features  
- Learn how to structure **event-driven systems**  
- Practice clean separation of concerns  
- Build real Observer-Pattern-based solutions  
- Prepare for LINQ, async/await, and advanced OOP patterns  

---

## 🧭 Next Steps (Recommended Learning Path)

1. **LINQ** (Where, Select, OrderBy, GroupBy...)  
2. Extension Methods  
3. Anonymous Types  
4. IEnumerable vs IQueryable  
5. async / await  
6. SOLID Principles  
7. Dependency Injection
